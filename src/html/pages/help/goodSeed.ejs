How should you create a seed that will get the attention of other members and be well received by your community?

We've put together a few tips from our own observations of what makes the best seeds.

Offers:

Let people know important details, like dates, times, or any value exchange you think is appropriate.
@Tag people in the Comment section who might be interested, or might be able to help spread the word.
Have people vouch for you in the comments.
Sometimes Offers aren’t a fit for the community they are posted in. Think about what you’d be interested in seeing, and what would get your attention.
Intentions:

Help us feel the “why” behind your Intention.
Outline some of the things you’ve thought about that might be necessary to make the Intention real.
Do you need people with specific skills or resources to help make it come true? Let us know!
Let people know things you’ve done before to ground the vision you’re sharing.
Tell us how soon you’d like to make it happen.
Requests:

Be very clear and specific.
Let people know “why” you need what you’re looking for.
Highlight any value exchange you might want to offer in return.
Thank people who help you!
All types of seeds should be clear and specific, and give important details--who, what, where, when.

And, most importantly, if people comment, make sure to follow up so that you can set things in motion.

Really, a Seed is a tiny story of a world that might be— something that might happen in the future, if the right people come together. If you can tell a good story about the future that might be, then with the support of our community, we can create anything we can imagine.
