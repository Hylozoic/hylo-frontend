		<h2>Getting Started</h2>

		<h3>How does it work?</h3>

		<p>Hylo is simple. You can post three types of content on Hylo:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>“Intention”: Something you’d like to create, and want others to join you in creating.</li>
			<li>“Offer”: Something you have that you’d like to share.</li>
			<li>“Request”: Something you’re looking for that you don’t know where to find.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We call these <strong>Seeds</strong>, because they sprout into conversations and collaborations.</p>

		<p>You can comment on seeds and <a href="#mention">@mention</a> people in your community in the comments. Soon, you’ll be able to share them with your friends on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

		<h3>How do I post?</h3>
		<p>From the community view, click the "Add Seed" button from the left hand side of the community toolbar. Follow the instructions on the "Add Seed" form to fill in your details and plant your seed.</p>

		<h3>How do I comment?</h3>
		<p>From any post, click the “comment” <show icon> button to open comments.</p>

		<h3>How do I notify other members about my seed?</h3>
		<p>There are two ways to accomplish this. The first is to @mention a member in the description of your seed, or in the comments.</p>
		<p>The second way to accomplish this is to click on the "Add Members" button and enter the member's name in the form.</p>

		<h3>How do I add a Topic to my seed?</h3>
		<p>You can add a <a href="#topic">topic</a> by typing a <strong>#</strong> followed by the topic keyword, i.e. a hashtag.</p>

		<h3>How do I see all the activity in my community?</h3>
		<p>On the top navigation bar, select the “Community” icon <i class="icon-communities-new"></i> on the left, and then select the community whose feed you’d like to view.</p>
		<p>To see notifications for Seeds you’ve joined, in the top navigation bar, select "Notifications" to go to a page with all of the recent activity on your Seeds, as well as new comments on Seeds you've joined.</p>

		<h3>Who can see my information?</h3>
		<p>Only the members of your community can see your profile, Seeds or any comments you have made. Members from other communities cannot see your profile or any of your activity. The site is currently in private Beta and none of the content on Hylo is available to the public.</p>

		<h2>Post Features</h2>

		<a name="mention"></a>
		<h3>@Mention</h3>
		<p>Use this feature to notify other members that you think would be interested in your Hylo or could help you spread the word. In the Hylo description or comments, just type <strong>@</strong> and start writing the person's name. A list will pop up for you to select your collaborator's name.</p>

		<a name="topic"></a>
		<h3>#Topics</h3>
		<p>A Topic (aka a hashtag) allows you to add a searchable keyword to your Hylo or comment. Just use the "#" to create #Topics. This makes it easier for people to find things that have a relevant #Topic. For example, if you are looking for a skill, you could type #programming or #writing and if your post is on a specific #Topic, you can type #books or #food. @Mentions and #Topics can be used in seed descriptions as well as in comments.</p>

		<h3>Joining</h3>
		<p>To Join a seed and receive updates, just click the Join button on any seed. Adding another member to a seed or @mentioning them in the seed or comments will also sign them up for updates on the seed.</p>
