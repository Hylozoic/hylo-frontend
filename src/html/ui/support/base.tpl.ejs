		<h2>Getting Started</h2>

		<h3>How does it work?</h3>

		<p>Hylo is simple. You can post three types of content on Hylo:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Intention</strong>: Something you’d like to create, and want others to join you in creating.</li>
			<li><strong>Offer</strong>: Something you have that you’d like to share.</li>
			<li><strong>Request</strong>: Something you’re looking for that you don’t know where to find.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We call these <strong>Seeds</strong>, because they sprout into conversations and collaborations.</p>

		<p>You can comment on seeds and <a href="#mention">@mention</a> people in your community in the comments. Soon, you’ll be able to share them with your friends on Facebook and Twitter.</p>

		<a name="post"></a>
		<h3>How do I post?</h3>
		<p>From the community view, click the "New Seed" button from the left hand side of the community toolbar. Follow the instructions on the "New Seed" form to fill in your details and plant your seed.</p>

		<h3>What should I post?</h3>
		<p>Here are some tips for creating great seeds that will get the attention of other members and be well received by your community.</p>

		<p><strong>Offers</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Include important details, like dates, times, and how you'd like to be compensated.</li>
			<li>Mention people in the comments (using @) who might be interested, or could help spread the word.</li>
			<li>Have people vouch for you in the comments.</li>
			<li>Make your offer appealing! Think about what you’d be interested in seeing, and what would get your attention.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Intentions</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Help people feel the “why” behind your intention.</li>
			<li>Outline some of the things you’ve thought about that might be necessary to make the intention real.</li>
			<li>Do you need people with specific skills or resources to help make it come true? Say so!</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Requests</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Let people know why you need what you’re looking for.</li>
			<li>Say what you could offer in return.</li>
			<li>Thank people who help you!</li>
			<li>Be clear and specific, and give important details: who, what, where, when.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>And, most importantly, if people comment, make sure to follow up so that you can set things in motion.</p>

		<p>A seed is a story of a world that might be—something that could happen if the right people come together. With a good story about the future, and the support of our community, we can create anything we can imagine.</p>

		<h2>Post Features</h2>

		<a name="mention"></a>
		<h3>@Mention</h3>
		<p>Use this feature to notify other members that you think would be interested in your Hylo or could help you spread the word. In the Hylo description or comments, just type <strong>@</strong> and start writing the person's name. A list will pop up for you to select your collaborator's name.</p>

		<a name="topic"></a>
		<h3>#Topics</h3>
		<p>A Topic (aka a hashtag) allows you to add a searchable keyword to your Hylo or comment. Just use the "#" to create #Topics. This makes it easier for people to find things that have a relevant #Topic. For example, if you are looking for a skill, you could type #programming or #writing and if your post is on a specific #Topic, you can type #books or #food. @Mentions and #Topics can be used in seed descriptions as well as in comments.</p>

		<h3>Joining</h3>
		<p>To Join a seed and receive updates, just click the Join button on any seed. Adding another member to a seed or @mentioning them in the seed or comments will also sign them up for updates on the seed.</p>
